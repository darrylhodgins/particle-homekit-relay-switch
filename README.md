# particle-homekit-relay-switch

A proof-of-concept using `homekit-server` and `homekit-relay-switch` libraries, which have been built using Particle's [Firmware Libraries guide](https://docs.particle.io/guide/tools-and-features/libraries/).

Note: The libraries in `/lib` were installed using Particle Workbench's **Particle: Install Library** command.  They should not be edited _in_ this repository.
